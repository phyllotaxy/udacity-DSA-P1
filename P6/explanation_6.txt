Reasoning:
As union and intersection are set operations, we need to use sets to collect the
elements of the linked lists.

Time complexity:
Assume the sizes of the inputs of list_1 and list_2 are m and n, respectively.
- Generation the corresponding sets takes O(n + m).
- Intersection is in O(n) or O(m), depending on which list is chosen to perform the
check.
- Union is in O(n + m). First, one of the sets need to be copied to a new set(unlike
intersection, where only an empty set needs to be created). Then we need to perform
the check on the other set, which makes the complexity in O(n + m).

Space Complexity:
- All are the same as time complexity.
