Reasoning:
The block chain should be implemented using a linked list. The datetime module
is used to generate GMT(UTC) time, the hashlib module is used to compute the hash,
and the json module is used to serialize each instance of the Block class.
The hash of a block is not computed when it is created (except for the first block),
as it requires the information of the previous block. It can only be computed
after the block chain object adds the block to the block chain.

Time Complexity:
-Adding a block to the block chain takes O(1).
-Printing the block chain takes O(n).

Space Complexity:
The size of the block chain is in O(n).
